# Research Question and Motivation 

According to the U.S. government's Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a virtual currency is a digital representation of value, other than a representation of the U.S. dollar or a foreign currency ("real currency"), that functions as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange. The IRS defines cryptocurrencies as a virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure digitally recorded transactions on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain.

Cryptocurrencies are mainstream assets electronically traded by many investors globally, similar to stocks and other equity types. There are many different cryptocurrencies, with several more being introduced to the public every few months for the opportunity to make transactions based on these assets.
